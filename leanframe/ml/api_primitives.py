Wraps primitives for machine learning with BQML

This library is an evolving attempt to
- implement BigFrames API for BQML
- follow as close as possible the API design of SKLearn

class BaseEstimator:
    """
    A BigFrames machine learning component following the SKLearn API design
    Ref: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/7db5b6a98ac6ad0976a3364966e214926ca8098a/sklearn/base.py#L112

    The estimator is the fundamental abstraction for all learning components. This includes learning
    algorithms, and also some preprocessing routines.

    This base class provides shared methods for inspecting parameters, and for building a consistent
    string representation of the component. By convention, the __init__ of all descendents will be
    assumed to be the list of hyperparameters.

    All descendents of this class should implement:

        def __init__(self, hyperparameter_1=default_1, hyperparameter_2=default_2, hyperparameter3, ...):
            '''Set hyperparameters'''
            self.hyperparameter_1 = hyperparameter_1
            self.hyperparameter_2 = hyperparameter_2
            self.hyperparameter3 = hyperparameter3
            ...

        def fit(self, x_train: Union[DataFrame, Series], y_train: Union[DataFrame, Series]):
            '''Train the model to predict y_train from x_train'''
            ...

    The types of decendents of this class should be:

    1) Predictors
        These extend the interface with a .predict(self, x_test) method which predicts the target values
        according to the parameters that were calculated in .fit()

            def predict(self, x_test: Union[DataFrame, Series]) -> Union[DataFrame, Series]:
                '''Predict the target values according to the parameters that were calculated in .fit'''
                ...

    2) Transformers
        These extend the interface with .transform(self, x) and .fit_transform(x_train) methods, which
        apply data processing steps such as scaling that must be fitted to training data

            def transform(self, x: Union[DataFrame, Series]) -> Union[DataFrame, Series]:
                '''Transform the data according to the parameters that were calculated in .fit()'''
                ...

            def fit_transform(self, x_train: Union[DataFrame, Series], y_train: Union[DataFrame, Series]):
                '''Perform both fit() and transform()'''
                ...

    By design, implementations of these to inherit from are not provided, as they have no shared logic.
    If models do have shared logic, they should share it with mixin classes.
