# leanframe

(This is not an official Google product.)

LeanFrame is a pandas-like API built on top of Ibis. This is a fork of an early version of leanframe (https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery-dataframes) and is intended to be a minimal wrapper on top of Ibis without any of the pandas features that make leanframe more complex.
